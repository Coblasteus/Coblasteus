# Why Coblasteus? (as in the name)
The namesake was made after hearing about the cytoplasm, which is the clear gel the cell membranes are in. I was then like “hmmm… cobalt…” and then I combined the two together. I was planning to make the name Cobaltplasm, but there’s already some artist on Pinterest with the same name, so I decided to combine "Cobalt" and "plasm" together, making "Coblasm". I then added some fluff; therefore, turning it into the final result: Coblasteus.


# Who are you?
I'm Coblasteus, of course! But seriously, if you find me and my website from somewhere or someone, just know I do a lot of things, such as:

- Music
- Gaming
- Game Dev
- And more
